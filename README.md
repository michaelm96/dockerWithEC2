# dockerWithEC2

This project was part of this course (https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-kubernetes-the-practical-guide/)

In here I learned how to 
1. build Docker image based on node locally
2. push to Docker hub
3. pull the image that just uploaded to aws ec2 instance
4. run it there with docker run command
